**Breaking Changes**:

- Possibly the settings file is not correctly migrated and needs to be manually adjusted.
- Rename `settings` to `settings.yaml`
- Add all keys which are missing. List will be available in `/var/log/cobbler/cobbler.log`.
- We dropped support for CentOS 7 since no full Python 3 stack is available
  [#2515](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2515)

**Announcement**:

- We will try to fade out Cheetah3 over time. Release 4.0.0 will contain only Jinja2 templates. We will aide and help
  with the transition and try to make it as smooth as possible
- We will remove the internal implementation of the TFTP daemon with 3.3.0. If you use it, please use one from your
  system vendor in the future.
