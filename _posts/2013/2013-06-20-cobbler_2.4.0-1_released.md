summary: Announcing the release of Cobbler 2.4.0-1.
---

I am happy to announce that after a year since the last release, Cobbler 2.4.0-1 is now officially available! The build
process has been started for Fedora/EPEL, so the packages should be available in the -testing repos within a day or two,
and in the stable branches following that (EPEL takes longer).

Some highlights of the release:

Major Features:

- Dynamic Settings (Sorry we don't have 2.4.0 docs anymore)
- Distro Signatures (Sorry we don't have 2.4.0 docs anymore)
- Vastly improved support for Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and VMware ESXi (5.0 and 5.1)
- Added in new templated scripting support (needs documentation)
- New web interface improvements (tabs, etc.)
- Added apt-specific fields for repositories to make mirroring them easier
- Support for parameterized classes and defines in puppet using management classes

Minor Features:

- Added the bonded_bridge_slave interface type:
- Improved template error reporting
- Variables in fields are now evaluated through the templating engine
- Added openvz as a virtualization type for koan
- Added --virt-pxe-boot option for koan to force PXE booting of new systems
- Added a per-interface gateway option, for systems that support it
- Added support for new puppet command syntax
- Exposed replication rsync options

Major Bugfixes:

- --available-as no longer copies all files.
- Improved gPXE/iPXE support, including FreeBSD
- Deleting objects now respects the --recursive option again

Minor Bugfixes:

- Too many to list

Thanks to everyone who made this release possible!
