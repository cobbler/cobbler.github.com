author: Enno
summary: Announcing the release of Cobbler 3.1.1.
---

This release syncs release30 with master. No patches for release30 were needed specifically.

I would like to especially thank [@Conan-Kudo](https://github.com/Conan-Kudo) for his work on the cross-distro specfile
for cobbler and koan as well as [@rbberger](https://github.com/rbberger) who was so kind to contribute a lot regarding
building the rpms in docker for CentOS with the specfile this helped a lot!

We have a 8497 line diff for this release. [link](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.0.1...v3.1.1)
