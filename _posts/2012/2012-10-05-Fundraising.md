summary: Announcing a fundraiser for Cobbler, to raise money to buy new hardware to help facilitate testing and to create a new continuous integration environment.

As cloud infrastructures (specifically Infrastructure as a Service platforms) become more commonplace, Cobbler will need
to be adapted to provide the same flexibility in image management as it does for bare-metal. The main challenge to
adding these features to date has been a lack of hardware for testing.

To overcome this, I have <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/cobbler24">launched an Indiegogo campaign</a> to raise money
for the project.

In addition to hardware for adding IaaS platform features, I also plan to use a dedicated server for running continuous
integration testing via Jenkins. Right now, all development and testing takes place on a single server running a handful
of VM's, so it's quite limiting performance-wise. Having a dedicated system that also automatically runs tests whenever
commits are made will greatly speed up the development and release time.

So, please spread the word and help to make Cobbler better!
