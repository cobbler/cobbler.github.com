title: Cobbler 2.2.3-2 Released
author: James
summary: Announcing the release of Cobbler 2.2.3-2. This release addresses a minor bug in the 2.2.3-1 release.
---
Minor release update to correct the DHCP config writing issue:

- [BUGFIX] re-enable writing of DHCP entries for non-pxeboot-enabled systems unless they're static

I applied the fix suggested in that thread, so now dhcpd.conf entries will not be written if netboot-enabled is False
and the interface is configured as static.

I'm starting to roll this out to Fedora now, so they should be in testing before long. This will replace the -1 release,
which will never make it out of testing.

Enjoy!
