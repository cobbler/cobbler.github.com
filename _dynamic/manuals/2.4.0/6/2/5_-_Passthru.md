title: Passthru Authentication

As of Cobbler 2.2.0, passthru authentication with Apache is no longer supported due to the fact that we have moved to a session/token based authentication and form-based login scheme with the new Web UI. Unfortunately, passthru authentication does not work with this method, so we now recommend using PAM or one of the other authentication schemes.
