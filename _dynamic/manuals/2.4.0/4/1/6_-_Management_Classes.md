Management classes allow cobbler to function as a configuration management system.  The lego blocks of configuration management, resources are grouped together via Management Classes and linked to a system. Cobbler supports two (2) resource types, which are configured in the order listed below:

1. {% linkup title:"Package Resources" extrameta:2.4.0 %}
2. {% linkup title:"File Resources" extrameta:2.4.0 %}
  
  
To add a Management Class, you would run the following command:
{% highlight bash %}
$ cobbler mgmtclass add --name=string --comment=string [--packages=list] [--files=list]
{% endhighlight %}

### name

### comment
A comment that describes the functions of the management class.

### packages
Specifies a list of package resources required by the management class.

### files
Specifies a list of file resources required by the management class.
