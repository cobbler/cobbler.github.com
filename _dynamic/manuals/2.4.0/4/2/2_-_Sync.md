title: Cobbler Sync
meta: 2.4.0

The sync command is very important, though very often unnecessary for most situations. It's primary purpose is to force a rewrite of all configuration files, distribution files in the TFTP root, and to restart managed services. So why is it unnecessary? Because in most common situations (after an object is edited, for example), Cobbler executes what is known as a "lite sync" which rewrites most critical files.

When is a full sync required? When you are using manage_dhcpd ({% linkup title:"Managing DHCP" extrameta:2.4.0 %}) with systems that use static leases. In that case, a full sync is required to rewrite the dhcpd.conf file and to restart the dhcpd service. Adding support for OMAPI is on the roadmap, which will hopefully relegate full syncs to troubleshooting situations.

**Example:**

{% highlight bash %}
$ cobbler sync
{% endhighlight %}

### How Sync Works

A full sync will perform the following actions:

1. Run pre-sync {% linkup title:"Triggers" extrameta:2.4.0 %}
2. Clean the TFTP tree of any and all files
3. Re-copy boot loaders to the TFTP tree
4. Re-copy distribution files to the TFTP tree
    * This will attempt to hardlink files if possible
5. Rewrite the pxelinux.cfg/default file
6. Rewrite all other pxelinux.cfg files for systems
7. Rewrite all managed config files (DHCP, DNS, etc.) and restarts services
8. Cleans the "link cache"
9. Executes post-sync and change {% linkup title:"Triggers" extrameta:2.4.0 %}

As noted above, this can take quite a bit of time if there are many distributions.
