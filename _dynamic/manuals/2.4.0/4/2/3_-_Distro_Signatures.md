Prior to Cobbler 2.4.0, import modules for each supported distro were separate and customized for each specific distribution. The values for breed and os-version were hard-coded into cobbler, so adding support for new distros or newer versions of an already supported distro required code changes and a complete Cobbler upgrade.

Cobbler 2.4.0 introduces the concept of distro signatures to make adding support for newer distro versions without requiring an upgrade to the rest of the system.

### Distro Signatures File

The distro signatures are stored in **/var/lib/cobbler/distro_signatures.json**. As the extension indicates, this is a JSON-formatted file, with the following structure:

{% highlight json %}
{"breeds":
 {
  "&lt;breed-name&gt;": {
   "&lt;os-version1&gt;": {
    "signatures": "...",
    "default_kickstart":"...",
    ...
   },
   ...
  }
  ...
 }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This file is read in when cobblerd starts, and logs a message noting how many breeds and os-versions it has loaded:

{% highlight bash %}
INFO | 9 breeds and 21 OS versions read from the signature file
{% endhighlight %}

### CLI Commands

The signature CLI command has the following sub-commands:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cobbler signature --help
usage
=====
cobbler signature report
cobbler signature update
{% endhighlight %}

#### cobbler signature report

This command prints out a report of the currently loaded signatures and os-versions.

{% highlight bash %}
$ cobbler signature report
Currently loaded signatures:
debian:
	squeeze
freebsd:
	8.2
	8.3
	9.0
generic:
	(none)

9 breeds with 21 total signatures loaded
{% endhighlight %}

An optional --name parameter can be specified to limit the report to one breed:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cobbler signature report --name=ubuntu
Currently loaded signatures:
ubuntu:
	oneiric
	precise
	quantal

Breed 'ubuntu' has 3 total signatures
{% endhighlight %}

#### cobbler signature update

This command will cause Cobbler to go and fetch the latest distro signature file from http://cobbler.github.con/signatures/latest.json, and load the signatures in that file. This file will be tested first, to ensure it is formatted correctly.

{% highlight bash %}
cobbler signature update
task started: 2012-11-21_222926_sigupdate
task started (id=Updating Signatures, time=Wed Nov 21 22:29:26 2012)
Successfully got file from http://cobbler.github.com/signatures/latest.json
*** TASK COMPLETE ***
{% endhighlight %}

This command currently takes no options.
