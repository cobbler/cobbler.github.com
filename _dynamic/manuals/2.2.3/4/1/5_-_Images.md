Cobbler can help with booting images physically and virtually, though the usage of these commands varies substantially by the type of image.  Non-image based deployments are generally easier to work with and lead to more sustaintable infrastructure. See https://fedorahosted.org/cobbler/wiki/AllAboutImages for details on things that are offered.  Some manual use of other commands beyond of what is typically required of cobbler may be needed to prepare images for use with this feature.
